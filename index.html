        Peshawar (/pəˈʃɑːwər/;[8] Pashto: پېښور [peˈχəwər] ⓘ; Hindko: پشور; [pɪˈʃɔːɾ] ⓘ; Urdu: پشاور [pɪˈʃɑːʋər] ⓘ) is
        the capital and largest city of the Pakistani province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. It is the sixth most populous city
        of Pakistan, with a district population of over 4.7 million in the 2023 census.[9][10] It is situated in the
        north-west of the country, lying in the Valley of Peshawar. Peshawar is primarily populated by Pashtuns, who
        comprise the second-largest ethnic group in the country.[11][12]

        Situated in the Valley of Peshawar, a broad area situated east of the historic Khyber Pass, Peshawar's recorded
        history dates back to at least 539 BCE, making it one of the oldest cities in South Asia.[13][14] The area
        encompassing modern-day Peshawar is mentioned in the Vedic scriptures; it was one of the principal cities of the
        ancient Gāndhāra. Peshawar served as the capital of the Kushan Empire during the rule of Kanishka[15][16][17]
        and was home to the Kanishka Stupa, which was among the tallest buildings in the ancient world.[18]

        Peshawar was then ruled by the Hephthalites, followed by the Hindu Shahis, before the arrival of a variety of
        Muslim empires. The city was an important trading Centre of the Mughal Empire before becoming part of the
        Durrani Empire in 1747, after which it served as the Durrani winter capital from 1776 until the capture of the
        city by the Sikh Empire in 1823. In 1849, the city was captured by the East India Company and subsequently
        became part of British Raj, under whose rule it remained until the Partition of British India and subsequent
        independence of Pakistan in 1947.

        Etymology

        A vintage photo postcard of the main street, Peshawar. Digitized by Panjab Digital Library.
        The modern name of the city "Peshawar" is possibly derived from the [reconstructed] Sanskrit word "Purushapura"
        (Sanskrit: पुरूषपुर Puruṣapura, meaning "City of Men" or "City of Purusha").[19][20][21] It was named so by
        Mughal Emperor Akbar from its old name Parashawar, the meaning of which Akbar did not understand.[22][23] The
        ruler of the city during its founding may have been a Hindu raja named Purush; the word pur means "city" in
        Sanskrit.[24][25][26] Sanskrit, written in the Kharosthi script, was the literary language (along with Gandhari
        Prakrit) employed by the Buddhist kingdoms which ruled over the area during its earliest recorded period.[27]
        The city's name may also be derived from the Sanskrit name for "City of Flowers," Poshapura, a name found in an
        ancient Kharosthi inscription that may refer to Peshawar.[28]

        Chinese Buddhist monk Xuanzang's seventh-century account of a city in Gandhara called the city Po-la-sha-pu-lo
        (Chinese: 布路沙布邏, bùlùshābùló), and an earlier fifth-century account by Fa-Hien records the city's name as
        Fou-lou-sha (Chinese: 弗樓沙, fùlóshā), the Chinese equivalent of the Sanskrit name of the city,
        Purushapura.[29][30] An ancient inscription from the Shapur era identifies a city in the Gandhara valley by the
        name pskbvr, which may be a reference to Peshawar.[31] <br>
      <br>

        The Arab historian and geographer al-Masudi noted that by the mid-tenth century, the city was known as
        Parashāwar. The name was noted to be Purshawar and Purushavar by al-Biruni.[32]

        The city began to be known as Peshāwar by the era of Emperor Akbar.[33] The current name is said by some to have
        been based upon the Persian word for "frontier town"[33] or, more literally, "forward city", though
        transcription errors and linguistic shifts may account for the city's new name. One theory suggests that the
        city's name is derived from the Persian name "Pesh Awardan", meaning "place of first arrival" or "frontier
        city", as Peshawar was the first city in the Indian subcontinent after crossing the Khyber Pass.[34][35] Akbar's
        bibliographer, Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak, lists the city's name as both Parashāwar, transcribed in Persian as
        پَرَشَاوَر,[36] and Peshāwar

It is the second largest city in Pakistan, after Karachi, and 27th largest in the world, with a population of over 14 million.[17] Lahore is one of Pakistan's major industrial, educational and economic hubs.[12][13] It has been the historic capital and cultural center of the wider Punjab region,[18][19][20] and is one of Pakistan's most socially liberal,[21] progressive,[22] and cosmopolitan cities.[23]

Lahore's origin dates back to antiquity. The city has been inhabited for around two millennia, although it rose to prominence in the late 10th century with the establishment of the Walled City, its fortified interior.[24] Lahore served as the capital of several empires during the medieval era, including the Hindu Shahis, Ghaznavid Empire and Delhi Sultanate. It reached the height of its splendor under the Mughal Empire between the late 16th and early 18th centuries, being its capital city for many years. During this period, it was one of the largest cities in the world.[25] The city was captured by the forces of the Afsharid ruler Nader Shah in 1739. Although 
 the Mughal authority was re-established, it fell into a period of decay while being contested among the Afghans and the Sikhs between 1748 and 1798. Lahore eventually became the capital of the Sikh Empire in the early 19th century, regaining some of its lost grandeur.[26] Lahore was annexed to the British Raj in 1849 and became the capital of British Punjab.[27] Lahore was central to the independence movements of British India, with the city being the site of both the Declaration of Indian Independence and the resolution calling for the establishment of Pakistan. It experienced some of the worst rioting during the Partition period preceding Pakistan's establishment.[28] Following the success of the Pakistan Movement and the subsequent partition of British India in 1947, Lahore was declared the capital of Pakistan's Punjab province.

Located in central-eastern Punjab, along the River Ravi, it is the largest Punjabi-speaking city in the world. Lahore exerts a strong cultural and political influence over Pakistan.[29] A UNESCO City of Literature and major centre for Pakistan's publishing industry, Lahore remains the foremost center of Pakistan's literary scene. The city is also a major centre of education,[30] with some of Pakistan's leading universities based in the city.[31] Lahore is home to Pakistan's Punjabi film industry, and is a major centre of Qawwali music.[32] The city also hosts much of Pakistan's tourism industry,[32][33] with major attractions including the Walled City, the famous Badshahi and Wazir Khan mosques, as well as several Sikh and Sufi shrines. Lahore is also home to the Lahore Fort and Shalimar Gardens, both of which are UNESCO World Heritage Sites.[33]

Etymology
Main article: Etymology of Lahore
The origin of Lahore's name is unclear. The city's name has been variously recorded by early Muslim historians as Luhawar, Lūhār, and Rahwar.[34] The Iranian polymath and geographer, Abu Rayhan al-Biruni, referred to the city as Luhāwar in his 11th century work, Qanun,[34] while the poet Amir Khusrow, who lived during the Delhi Sultanate period, recorded the city's name as Lāhanūr.[35] Yaqut al-Hamawi records the city's name as Lawhūr, mentioning that it was famously known as Lahāwar.[36] Persian historian Firishta mentions the city as Alahwar in his work, with al-Ahwar being another variation.[37][38]

One theory suggests that Lahore's name is a corruption of the word Ravāwar, as R to L shifts are common in languages derived from Sanskrit.[39] Ravāwar is the simplified pronunciation of the name Iravatyāwar, a name possibly derived from the Ravi River, known as the Iravati River in the Vedas.[39][40] Another theory suggests the city's name may derive from the word Lohar, meaning "blacksmith".[41]

According to a legend,[42][43] Lahore's name derives from Lavpur or Lavapuri (City of Lava),[44] and is said to have been founded by Prince Lava,[45] the son of Sita and Rama. The same account attributes the founding of nearby Kasur to his twin brother Kusha,[46] though it was actually established in the 16th century.[47hra

Origins
Main article: Origins of Lahore
No definitive record of Lahore's early history exists, and its ambiguous historical background has given rise to various theories about its establishment and history.[48]

Alexander the Great's historians make no mention of any city near Lahore's location during his invasion in 326 BCE, suggesting the city had not been founded by that point or was not noteworthy.[49] Ptolemy mentions in his Geography a city called Labokla situated near the Chenab and Ravi rivers which may have been in reference to ancient Lahore, or an abandoned predecessor of the city.[50] Chinese pilgrim Xuanzang gave a vivid description of a large and prosperous unnamed city that may have been Lahore when he visited the region in 630 CE during his tour of India.[51]

The first document that mentions Lahore by name is the Hudud al-'Alam ("The Regions of the World"), written in 982 CE,[52] in which Lahore is mentioned as a town which had "impressive temples, large markets and huge orchards".[24][53]

Lahore, previously a town, first emerged as a notable city in 11th century during the era of Sufi saint Ali al-Hajvery.[54] Few other references to Lahore remain from before its capture by the Ghaznavid Sultan Mahmud in the 11th century. During this time, Lahore appears to have served as the capital of Punjab under Raja Anandapala of the Üdi Shahi empire, who moved his capital there from Waihind.[51][55]

Origins
Main article: Origins of Lahore
No definitive record of Lahore's early history exists, and its ambiguous historical background has given rise to various theories about its establishment and history.[48]

Alexander the Great's historians make no mention of any city near Lahore's location during his invasion in 326 BCE, suggesting the city had not been founded by that point or was not noteworthy.[49] Ptolemy mentions in his Geography a city called Labokla situated near the Chenab and Ravi rivers which may have been in reference to ancient Lahore, or an abandoned predecessor of the city.[50] Chinese pilgrim Xuanzang gave a vivid description of a large and prosperous unnamed city that may have been Lahore when he visited the region in 630 CE during his tour of India.[51]

The first document that mentions Lahore by name is the Hudud al-'Alam ("The Regions of the World"), written in 982 CE,[52] in which Lahore is mentioned as a town which had "impressive temples, large markets and huge orchards".[24][53]

Lahore, previously a town, first emerged as a notable city in 11th century during the era of Sufi saint Ali al-Hajvery.[54] Few other references to Lahore remain from before its capture by the Ghaznavid Sultan Mahmud in the 11th century. During this time, Lahore appears to have served as the capital of Punjab under Raja Anandapala of the Üdi Shahi empire, who moved his capital there from Waihind.[51][55]

    Lahore (/ləˈhɔːr/ lə-HOR; Punjabi: لہور [lɔː˥˩ɾᵊ]; Urdu: لاہور [laːˈɦɔːɾ] ⓘ) is the capital and largest city of the Pakistani province of Punjab. It is the second largest city in Pakistan, after Karachi, and 27th largest in the world, with a population of over 14 million.[17] Lahore is one of Pakistan's major industrial, educational and economic hubs.[12][13] It has been the historic capital and cultural center of the wider Punjab region,[18][19][20] and is one of Pakistan's most socially liberal,[21] progressive,[22] and cosmopolitan cities.[23]

Lahore's origin dates back to antiquity. The city has been inhabited for around two millennia, although it rose to prominence in the late 10th century with the establishment of the Walled City, its fortified interior.[24] Lahore served as the capital of several empires during the medieval era, including the Hindu Shahis, Ghaznavid Empire and Delhi Sultanate. It reached the height of its splendor under the Mughal Empire between the late 16th and early 18th centuries, being its capital city for many years. During this period, it was one of the largest cities in the world.[25] The city was captured by the forces of the Afsharid ruler Nader Shah in 1739. Although the Mughal authority was re-established, it fell into a period of decay while being contested among the Afghans and the Sikhs between 1748 and 1798. Lahore eventually became the capital of the Sikh Empire in the early 19th century, regaining some of its lost grandeur.[26] Lahore was annexed to the British Raj in 1849 and became the capital of British Punjab.[27] Lahore was central to the independence movements of British India, with the city being the site of both the Declaration of Indian Independence and the resolution calling for the establishment of Pakistan. It experienced some of the worst rioting during the Partition period preceding Pakistan's establishment.[28] Following the success of the Pakistan Movement and the subsequent partition of British India in 1947, Lahore was declared the capital of Pakistan's Punjab province.

Located in central-eastern Punjab, along the River Ravi, it is the largest Punjabi-speaking city in the world. Lahore exerts a strong cultural and political influence over Pakistan.[29] A UNESCO City of Literature and major centre for Pakistan's publishing industry, Lahore remains the foremost center of Pakistan's literary scene. The city is also a major centre of education,[30] with some of Pakistan's leading universities based in the city.[31] Lahore is home to Pakistan's Punjabi film industry, and is a major centre of Qawwali music.[32] The city also hosts much of Pakistan's tourism industry,[32][33] with major attractions including the Walled City, the famous Badshahi and Wazir Khan mosques, as well as several Sikh and Sufi shrines. Lahore is also home to the Lahore Fort and Shalimar Gardens, both of which are UNESCO World Heritage Sites.[33]

Etymology
Main article: Etymology of Lahore
The origin of Lahore's name is unclear. The city's name has been variously recorded by early Muslim historians as Luhawar, Lūhār, and Rahwar.[34] The Iranian polymath and geographer, Abu Rayhan al-Biruni, referred to the city as Luhāwar in his 11th century work, Qanun,[34] while the poet Amir Khusrow, who lived during the Delhi Sultanate period, recorded the city's name as Lāhanūr.[35] Yaqut al-Hamawi records the city's name as Lawhūr, mentioning that it was famously known as Lahāwar.[36] Persian historian Firishta mentions the city as Alahwar in his work, with al-Ahwar being another variation.[37][38]

One theory suggests that Lahore's name is a corruption of the word Ravāwar, as R to L shifts are common in languages derived from Sanskrit.[39] Ravāwar is the simplified pronunciation of the name Iravatyāwar, a name possibly derived from the Ravi River, known as the Iravati River in the Vedas.[39][40] Another theory suggests the city's name may derive from the word Lohar, meaning "blacksmith".[41]

According to a legend,[42][43] Lahore's name derives from Lavpur or Lavapuri (City of Lava),[44] and is said to have been founded by Prince Lava,[45] the son of Sita and Rama. The same account attributes the founding of nearby Kasur to his twin brother Kusha,[46] though it was actually established in the 16th century.[47]
